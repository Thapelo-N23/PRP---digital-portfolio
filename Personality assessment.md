##  Reflection (Using STAR Technique)

**S – Situation:**  
To understand how my personality affects my work style and collaboration, I took an online personality assessment that was presented on blackboard.

**T – Task:**  
I wanted to explore how I function in teams and what environments I thrive in.

**A – Action:**  
I completed the 16Personalities test and reflected on the accuracy of the results.

**R – Result:**  
The INTP result made sense — I enjoy solving complex problems and working independently. It also helped me understand how to communicate better with others on group projects.
